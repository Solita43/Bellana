## Overview


 * Here is a link to the live demo: https://bellana.onrender.com

 * Bellana is a project management web application inspired by Asana. This application was designed and developed using an agile methodolgy, breaking the project into manageable tasks and iterations, and regularly evaluating progress to ensure timely completion. 

 * A few things I learned and improved on:
    * How to use react beatiful dnd for creating a smooth drag and drop experience for the user on the Kanban boards
    * How to better navigate and approach adding to or changing parts of a complex built out feature.
    * How to better plan and organize adding new features to a web application.
    * How to use figma to create wireframes for a project.
